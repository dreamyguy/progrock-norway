# Progressive Rock - Norway

A simple single-page app featuring Norwegian Progressive Rock Artists. :guitar:

If it exists, the page will list their Facebook Page & Spotify Artist Profile. through their respective social widgets. From there one can see both Facebook Page Like and Spotify Follow statuses, which one can conveniently change from there.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Releasing

Run `npm run deploy`. That's it! :sparkles:

It will run `ng build --prod --base-href https://dreamyguy.github.io/progrock-norway/` and then `ngh`.

The command `ngh` will deploy the production build to its respective [Github Page](https://dreamyguy.github.io/progrock-norway/). This command is provided by the `angular-cli-ghpages` dependency, which is no longer a part of Angular core.
